# tree-sitter-transparency
tree-sitter Transparency parser

## config

the .config/tree-sitter directory should be copied (or merged into)
your ~/.config/tree-sitter directory.  tree-sitter tools and commands,
including `tree-sitter highlight`, use it to find parsers and to choose
colors according to your chosen coloring scheme.  this is true, as far
as I know, even when tree-sitter is used by editors.
